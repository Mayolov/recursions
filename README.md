# recursions
Data Structures test1
These programs were used to study and memorize ways to use recursive methods. 
These are key questions that may be asked during the ComSc 76 course for EVC.
Hope this helps anyone reading the textbook or needs to study a bit more because,
you dont get recursion until you get recursion.
